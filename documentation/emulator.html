If you want to load your code into the emulator, just click "<B>Emulate</B>" button
<IMG SRC="img/emulator01.gif">.
<BR>
But you can also use emulator to load executables even if you don't have
the original source code. Select <B>Show emulator</B> from the <B>Emulator</B> menu.

Try loading files from "<B>MyBuild</B>" folder. If there are no files in "<B>MyBuild</B>" folder
return to source editor, select <I>Examples</I> from <I>File</I> menu, load any sample, compile it and
then load into the emulator:

[<B>Single Step</B>] button executes instructions one by one stopping after
each instruction.

<BR><BR>
[<B>Run</B>] button executes instructions one by one with delay set by <B>step delay</B>
between instructions.


<BR><BR>
Double click on register text-boxes opens "<B>Extended Viewer</B>" window
with value of that register converted to all possible forms. You can modify the
value of the register directly in this window.


<BR><BR>
Double click on memory list item opens "<B>Extended Viewer</B>" with WORD value loaded from
memory list at selected location.
Less significant byte is at lower address: LOW BYTE is loaded
from selected position and HIGH BYTE from next memory address.
You can modify the value of the memory word directly in the "<B>Extended Viewer</B>" window,


<BR><BR>
You can modify the values of registers on runtime by typing over the existing values.

<BR><BR>
[<B>Flags</B>] button allows you to view and modify flags on runtime.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Virtual drives</B></FONT>
<BR><BR>

Emulator supports up to 4 virtual floppy drives. By default there is
a <B>FLOPPY_0</B> file that is an image of a real floppy disk (the size of
that file is exactly 1,474,560 bytes).

<BR><BR>

To add more floppy drives select <NOBR><B>[Create new floppy drive]</B></NOBR> from
<NOBR><B>[Virtual drive]</B></NOBR> menu. Each time you add a floppy drive emulator
creates a <B>FLOPPY_1</B>, <B>FLOPPY_2</B>, and <B>FLOPPY_3</B> files.<BR>
Created floppy disks are images of empty IBM/MS-DOS formatted disk images.
Only <B>4</B> floppy drives are supported (0..3)!<BR>
To <B>delete</B> a floppy drive you should close the emulator, delete the
required file manually and restart the emulator.
<BR><BR>
You can determine the number of attached floppy drives using <B>INT 11h</B>
this function returns <B>AX</B> register with BIOS equipment list. Bits 7 and 6
define the number of floppy disk drives (minus 1):
<PRE>
Bits 7-6 of AX:
          00 single floppy disk.
          01 two floppy disks.
          10 three floppy disks.
          11 four floppy disks.
</PRE>
Emulator starts counting attached floppy drives from starting from the first,
in case file <B>FLOPPY_1</B> does not exist it stops the check
and ignores <B>FLOPPY_2</B> and <B>FLOPPY_3</B> files.
<BR><BR>
To write and read from floppy drive you can use <B>INT 13h</B> function,
see <A HREF="8086_bios_and_dos_interrupts.html"><B>list of supported interrupts</B></A> for more information.
